  buffer
  web buffer
    The content of a web page, not including its window or view.

    You can learn the basics of buffer handling in :ref:`managing_buffers`.

  command
  commands
    A command is a named action doable in the browser.

    See :ref:`concept_commands` for a detailed description.

    See :ref:`Commands <user_conf_commands>` for a list of commands; or better,
    use the :cmd:`describe-commands` command to get live documentation.

  hinting
   Hinting is used to navigate through the visible links and objects of the
   current web buffer's page, using the keyboard only.

   See :ref:`link_hinting` for more information.

  key binding
  key bindings
    A **key binding** is a combination of key presses used to trigger commands.

    See :ref:`concept_commands` for a detailed description, and
    :ref:`user_conf_binding_keys` for custom configuration of key bindings.

  keymap
  keymaps
    A **keymap** is an object holding a mapping between key bindings and
    commands.

    See :ref:`concept_commands` for a detailed description.

    See :ref:`Keymaps <user_conf_keymaps>` for a list of keymaps; or better, use
    the :cmd:`describe-bindings` command to get live documentation.

  minibuffer
    The minibuffer is what can be seen at the bottom of a webmacs window. It
    displays some information on the right, such as the currently active keymap
    and the number of open buffers.

  minibuffer input
    When webmacs is waiting for some information from you, the
    **minibuffer input** is shown: it's a text edit field in which you can type
    some text.

    Often, there also is a completion list above the minibuffer input.

  variable
  variables
    Some behaviors of *webmacs* can be customized using variables.

    See :ref:`user_conf_variables` for variables configuration.

    See :ref:`All variables <user_conf_all_variables>` to see all the variables;
    or better, use :cmd:`describe-variables` to get live documentation.

  view
  views
    A view is a part of a window displaying a buffer. There can be multiple
    views in one window.

    See :ref:`managing_views`.

  webjump
  webjumps
    A Webjump represents a quick way to access a URL, possibly with a variable
    part. A webjump name becomes a part of the webmacs :cmd:`go-to` command, so
    for example you can type ``google foo bar`` to execute a Google query with
    "foo bar" terms.

    See :ref:`user_conf_webjumps` to see the builtins webjumps and how to
    configure your owns.
