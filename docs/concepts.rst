Concepts
========

Please be sure to understand the following basic webmacs concepts before going
further reading the documentation.


Commands, key bindings and keymaps
**********************************

Those are quite similar to the definitions found in the emacs manual.

- A **command** is a named action doable in the browser. For example
  :cmd:`follow` is the command that allow to start hinting links to navigate.

- A **key binding** is a combination of key presses used to trigger commands.
  Key bindings are represented as in emacs, for example **C-x C-b** means
  holding the Control key while pressing x, then b on the keyboard.

  .. note::

    The control key is called a modifier. There are three keyboard modifiers:

    - **C** represents the Control key.
    - **M** represents the Alt key.
    - **S** represents the Super key (often called the window key)

  .. note::

    .. current-keymap:: webbuffer

    A key binding can be a single key press too. For example pressing :key:`f`
    while in the :keymap:`webbuffer` keymap will trigger the :cmd:`follow`
    command.

- A **keymap** is an object holding a mapping between key bindings and commands,
  so that a command can be triggered by pressing keyboard keys. There is one
  global keymap, and one active local keymap usually activated at the same
  time - the local keymap changes interactively depending on the context.

  Some important keymaps:

  .. webmacs-keymaps::
    :only: global, webbuffer, webcontent-edit, caret-browsing


Web buffers
***********

Web buffers are like emacs buffers, but for web pages. They are like tabs in
other browsers, except that they are not bound to any frame or window.

Windows, views (or frames)
**************************

Unlike the terminology in emacs, a window is a what we nowadays usually call a
window and views (sometimes called frames) are contained in windows.

Minibuffer
**********

The minibuffer is what can be seen at the bottom of a webmacs window. It
displays some information on the right, like the currently active keymap and the
number of opened buffers. When webmacs is waiting some information from you, the
**minibuffer input** is shown: it's a text edit field in which you can type some
text.
